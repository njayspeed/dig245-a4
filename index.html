          <p>You would think college websites are easy to use so
          that users could access information about the college easily.
          We decided to put this to the test using our own Davidson
          college website. We put together 5 tasks for a user to complete
          and took notes on the time to complete the task, the emotional
          response of the user, the efficieny of the user, and responsiveness
          to the site. You can see the results below.</p>
